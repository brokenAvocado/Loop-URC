Warning (dynamic data element):  When "INTERPOLATED" is selected for the
print method, the print frequency feature cannot be used.  PRINT.Freq is
being reset to zero (disabled) and execution is continuing.
 The GGL formulation is turned on.

[1276]
Warning:  In the dynamic data element, the step size is larger
than the print interval specified in the system data element.  The step
size is being reset so that it equals the print interval.
  PRint.interval = 0.41176470588235E-01
  old MAX.int.step = 5.0000000000000E-02
  new MAX.int.step = 0.41176470588235E-01
NOTE:  The Time Series Global Output element will reduce PRint.interval
       when the Output Rate variable is set to two or more.

Warning:  Prior to assembly the number of constraints, drivers and
initial conditions is not equal to the number of generalized
coordinates.  The assembly algorithm will be executed but the
result will represent one of several possible solutions.
Number of constraints, drivers, I.C's =                  146
Number of generalized coordinates     =                  141

Results achieved by the model assembly process with drivers:

  Number of function evaluations =     1
  Maximum constraint violation   =   0.250910E-13
